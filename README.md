# Hi folks <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I am a Software Developer with 3+ years of experience building scalable, high-performance systems across frontend, backend, and mobile platforms. At Orange Health Labs, I have led impactful projects including OMS Centralization (cutting operational costs by 10‚Äì15% and eliminating weekly slowdowns through SuperLab decoupling) and the Technician Workflow project (automating manual processes and enabling real-time task monitoring with Firestore).

Previously at GoodWorker, I optimized and rebuilt core portals, boosting performance scores from 18 to 90+ and improving hiring efficiency by 30‚Äì40%. I also contributed to cross-platform mobile app development with React Native, driving higher platform adoption.

My expertise spans JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, NestJS, Node.js, React Native, and SQL/NoSQL databases, with a strong focus on building reliable, user-centric solutions. I thrive in solving complex engineering challenges, mentoring teammates, and delivering measurable business impact through technology.

I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies and continuously learning and growing to provide more value to my clients. My areas of expertise include web development, competitive coding, and mathematics.

If you're looking for a dedicated and experienced software developer to bring your projects to life, I would be thrilled to connect with you. Let's work together to create innovative software solutions that exceed expectations.
